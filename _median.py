Median

We need an accurate census of our troops as this data is vital to our security
in the region. To get started, let's make sure that our census takers are up on
their statistics skills.

A median is a numerical value separating the upper half of a sorted array of
numbers from the lower half. In a list where there are an odd number of
entities, the median is the number found in the middle of the array. If the
array contains an even number of entities, then there is no single middle
value, instead the median becomes the average of the two numbers found in the
middle.

For this mission, you are given a non-empty array of natural numbers (X). With
it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers from the lower half and
find the median.

Input: An array as a list or a tuple of integers.

Output: The median as a float or an integer.

Example:

median([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3
median([3, 1, 2, 5, 3]) == 3
median([1, 300, 2, 200, 1]) == 2
median((3, 6, 20, 99, 10, 15)) == 12.5
Precondition:

1 < |data| â‰¤ 1000

How it is used:

The median has usage for Statistics and Probability theory, it has especially
significant value for skewed distribution. Here's an example: we want to know
the average income of people from a set of data and 100 people earn $100 in
month while 10 people earn $1,000,000. If we average it out we get $91,000.
This is weird value and does nothing to show us the real picture.
In this case the median would give to us more useful value and a better
picture. The Article at Wikipedia.
