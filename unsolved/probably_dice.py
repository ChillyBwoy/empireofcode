Probably Dice

Battle is full of randomnesses. You should observe randomness in a controlled
setting to prepare for this inevitability. We'll start by rolling the dice.

Typically, when using multiple dice, you simply roll them and sum up all the
result. To get started with your investigation of dice probability, write a
function that takes the number of dice, the number of sides per die and a
target number and returns the probability of getting a total roll of exactly
the target value. The result should be given with four digits precision as
±0.0001. For example, if you roll 2 six-sided dice, the probability of getting
exactly a 3 is 2/36 or 5.56%, which you should return as ≈0.0556.

For each test, assume all the dice are the same and are numbered from 1 to the
number of sides, inclusive. So a 4-sided die (D4) would have an equal chance of
rolling a 1, 2, 3 or 4. A 20-sided die (D20) would have an equal chance of
rolling any number from 1 to 20.

Tips: Be careful if you want to use a brute-force solution -- you could have a
very, very long wait for edge cases.

Input: Three arguments. The number of dice, the number of sides per die and the
target number as integers.

Output: The probability of getting exactly target number on a single roll of
the given dice as a float.

Example:

probability(2, 6, 3) == 0.0556  # 2 six-sided dice have a 5.56% chance of
totalling 3
probability(2, 6, 4) == 0.0833
probability(2, 6, 7) == 0.1667
probability(2, 3, 5) == 0.2222  # 2 three-sided dice have a 22.22% chance of
totalling 5
probability(2, 3, 7) == 0       # The maximum you can roll on 2 three-sided
dice is 6
probability(3, 6, 7) == 0.0694
probability(10, 10, 50) == 0.0375
Precondition:

1 ≤ dice_number ≤ 10

2 ≤ sides ≤ 20

0 ≤ target < 1000

How it is used:

This task illustrates basic probability. Many events can be described as the
combination of other events. In this case you're combining several dice into
one total to crit the Orc King for massive damage.
